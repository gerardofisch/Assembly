# Assembly
This repository have all the programs developed on Assembly during the course Embedded Systems 
Design, that I took on the second semester of 2021 at the NTUST. The codes were ran on the
Arduino UNO board.

## Purpose of the Labs:

### Lab2: Binary Coded Decimal Counter using seven-segment display
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the students to embedded systems. The students need
to design a 4-digit seven-segment display counter (hint, think about how to build a BCD counter and
decode the BCD value to a seven-segment display). 

### Lab3: DHT11 (Humidity and Temperature Sensor) to seven-segment display
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the students to a one-wire protocol device used with
embedded systems and for the student to learn about one-wire protocol. The students need to design a
one wire (DHT11) to 4-digit seven-segment display (hint, think about how to decode the DHT11 sensor
and convert it to BCD for use on the 4-digit seven-segment display). 

### Lab4: Displaying DHT11 information with LED matrix
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the students to a how shift registers (74HC595) as IO
expanders by displaying DHT11 collected information via an 8x8 LED dot matrix (1588BS) display.

### Lab5: Embedded System Design Lab 5: Musical keyboard with display
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the students to waveform generation using interrupts
by displaying info unique message via an 8x8 LED dot matrix (1588BS) display.
